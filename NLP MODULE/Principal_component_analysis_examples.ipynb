    "## Dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A widely encountered problem in machine learning is that of dimensionality. We typically refer to the size or shape of a dataset as an $n$ x $p$ matrix, where each row from 1 to $n$ represents an observation or data point, and each column from 1 to $p$ represents a variable or feature. With each additional feature, the dimensionality of a dataset increases by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems with increasing or high levels of dimensionality are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More storage space required for the data;\n",
    "- More computation time required to work with the data; and\n",
    "- More features mean more chance of feature correlation, and hence feature redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter point is the basis on which **principal component analysis** is carried out. A feature that is highly correlated with another increases when the other increases (positive correlation) or decreases when the other increases (negative correlation). This is helpful because if multiple features tend to behave in a corresponding manner in the dataset, they can often be replaced by some smaller number of representative feature(s). This helps to lower the feature space within which the data reside, reducing computation time as well as storage capacity requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of dimensionality reduction is to **reduce the number of features in a dataset while minimising the amount of data loss**. There are three primary methods by which this can be done:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)\n",
    "- Generalised Discriminant Analysis (GDA)\n",

    "The premise of PCA is that data in some higher number of dimensions can be mapped to some lower number of dimensions whilst retaining the maximum amount of variance in the lower dimension. Broadly speaking, the following steps are involved in a PCA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform feature scaling on data; \n",
    "2. Construct the covariance matrix of the data;\n",
    "3. Compute the eigenvectors of this matrix. The eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are used to reconstruct a maximal fraction of variance of the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are unfamiliar terms, which we encourage you to investigate on your own. The general idea is that we are able to compute a vector within the feature space of the dataset, which points in the direction of the maximum variance found in the data. This vector is known as the principal component, and we say that it _explains_ the most variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second principal component is that vector which is orthogonal (mutually perpendicular) to the first principal component, and which again explains the maximum variance in this orthogonal direction. The third principal component is orthogonal to both of the first two and explains the maximum variance in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This continues for each additional principal component until the maximum number of `p` principal components (there cannot be more principal components than there are features). 100% of the variance can only be explained by all `p` of the features, so we expect to lose some data while reducing the number of dimensions. However, because the principal components are orthogonal and ranked in decreasing order of variance explained, we do normally expect that some subset of all the features will explain a significant proportion of the data.\n",
