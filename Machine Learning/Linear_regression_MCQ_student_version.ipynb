    "Consider the theoretical setup for a stacking ensemble model designed for a regression task. The first layer of this model includes three different types of regression models: linear regression, ridge regression, and a support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. The second layer, or the final estimator, uses a linear regression model to combine the predictions from the first layer. The goal is to theoretically predict `Standard_yield` based on features such as `Elevation`, `Slope`, `Soil_fertility`, and `Pollution_level`, with the intention to evaluate the model's hypothetical performance using the Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n",
