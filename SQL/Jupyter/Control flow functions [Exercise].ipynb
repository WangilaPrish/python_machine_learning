    "1. **Identify required fields:** The first part of the problem is straightforward. We're being asked to retrieve `ProductName`, `UnitsInStock`, and `UnitPrice` from our `Products` table. These fields can be directly selected in our SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Categorise stock levels:** We need to create a new field, `StockStatus`, that categorises the stock level based on the `UnitsInStock`. This requires the use of a control flow function – specifically, a `CASE` statement. The `CASE` statement allows us to conditionally return results based on the value of another field. In this case, we will categorise `UnitsInStock` as 'Low' if less than 20, 'Medium' if between 20 and 50, and 'High' if more than 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Categorise price levels:** Similarly, we need to create another field, `PriceLevel`, that categorises the price of a product based on the `UnitPrice`. We'll again use a `CASE` statement to accomplish this. We will categorise `UnitPrice` as *Cheap* if less than \\$10, *Affordable* if between \\$10 and \\$50, and *Expensive* if more than \\$50."
